      <p class="mb-4">Battery life remains one of the biggest concerns for smartphone users. While battery technology continues to improve, our increasing reliance on smartphones for everything from communication to entertainment means we're using them more than ever. These practical tips can help you maximize your device's battery life, whether you're using an Android phone or an iPhone.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. Optimize Your Display Settings</h2>
      
      <p class="mb-4">Your smartphone's display is typically the biggest battery drain. Making these adjustments can significantly extend battery life:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Reduce brightness:</strong> Lower your screen brightness or use auto-brightness which adjusts based on ambient light</li>
        <li><strong>Shorten screen timeout:</strong> Set your screen to turn off after 30 seconds or 1 minute of inactivity</li>
        <li><strong>Use dark mode:</strong> On phones with OLED or AMOLED screens (most flagship devices), dark mode can significantly reduce battery consumption</li>
        <li><strong>Disable always-on displays:</strong> Features like Always-On Display (AOD) or ambient display are convenient but consume extra battery</li>
      </ul>

    <p class="mt-4 italic text-gray-500">By implementing these strategies, you can often squeeze more usage time out of each charge. If your battery still drains unusually fast, consider contacting Smart Services IT for diagnostics.</p>
