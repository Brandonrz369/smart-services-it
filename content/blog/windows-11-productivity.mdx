      <p class="mb-4">Windows 11 brings a refreshed design and new features that can significantly improve your productivity. In this article, we'll explore ten features that can help streamline your workflow and get more done with less effort.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. Snap Layouts and Snap Groups</h2>
      
      <p class="mb-4">Windows 11 enhances the window snapping functionality with Snap Layouts, allowing you to choose from predefined window arrangements when you hover over the maximize button. Once you've created a layout, Windows remembers these window groupings as Snap Groups, making it easy to switch between different tasks.</p>
      
      <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-6">
        <p class="font-medium text-blue-700">Pro Tip: Press Win + Z to quickly access Snap Layouts without hovering over the maximize button.</p>
      </div>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Focus Sessions</h2>
      
      <p class="mb-4">The updated Clock app in Windows 11 includes Focus Sessions, which integrates with Spotify and Microsoft To Do. This feature helps you work in concentrated bursts using the Pomodoro Technique, with built-in timers and task tracking to keep you on target.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Virtual Desktops</h2>
      
      <p class="mb-4">While virtual desktops existed in Windows 10, Windows 11 makes them more accessible and customizable. You can now assign different wallpapers to each desktop and easily reorder them. This is perfect for separating work, personal projects, and entertainment.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. Microsoft Teams Integration</h2>
      
      <p class="mb-4">Windows 11 integrates Microsoft Teams directly into the taskbar, making it easier to connect with colleagues, friends, and family. Quick access to Teams calls and chats can save valuable time during collaborative work.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. Improved Voice Typing</h2>
      
      <p class="mb-4">Windows 11's voice typing feature has been significantly enhanced. Press Win + H to activate it, and you'll find it's more accurate and responsive than in previous versions. It now also supports automatic punctuation insertion, making dictation more efficient.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">6. Quick Settings and Notifications Panel</h2>
      
      <p class="mb-4">The redesigned Quick Settings panel separates system controls from notifications, reducing clutter and making it easier to adjust common settings like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and volume without distractions.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">7. Improved Multi-Monitor Support</h2>
      
      <p class="mb-4">Windows 11 remembers how your windows were arranged on external monitors. When you disconnect a laptop from an external display and reconnect it later, all your windows will return to their previous positions automatically.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">8. PowerToys Run</h2>
      
      <p class="mb-4">While technically a separate download, Microsoft's PowerToys for Windows 11 includes the powerful Run utility. Press Alt + Space to quickly launch apps, search files, and perform calculations without leaving your keyboard.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">9. Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI</h2>
      
      <p class="mb-4">For developers, Windows 11 supports GUI applications in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), allowing you to run Linux visual applications alongside your Windows apps without needing dual-boot or virtual machines.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">10. Touch and Pen Improvements</h2>
      
      <p class="mb-4">If you use a touchscreen device, Windows 11 brings larger touch targets, improved gesture recognition, and haptic feedback support for certain pens. The touch keyboard has also been redesigned with better key spacing and integrated GIF and emoji pickers.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      
      <p class="mb-4">Windows 11 offers numerous features designed to enhance productivity and streamline your workflow. By taking advantage of these tools, you can save time, reduce distractions, and accomplish more throughout your workday.</p>
