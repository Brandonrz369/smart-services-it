      <p class="mb-4">Network issues can bring productivity to a halt, whether you're working from home or running a small business. While some network problems require professional assistance, many common issues can be resolved with some basic troubleshooting. This guide covers the most frequent network problems and their solutions.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. No Internet Connection</h2>
      
      <p class="mb-4">When your device shows no internet connection, follow these steps in order:</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Check Physical Connections</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Ensure all cables are securely connected to your modem, router, and devices</li>
        <li>Verify that your modem and router are powered on (look for indicator lights)</li>
        <li>If using Wi-Fi, confirm your device's Wi-Fi is enabled</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Restart Your Network Equipment</h3>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Power off your modem and router</li>
        <li>Wait 30 seconds</li>
        <li>Power on your modem and wait for it to fully initialize (usually 1-2 minutes)</li>
        <li>Power on your router and wait for it to fully initialize</li>
        <li>Reconnect your device to the network</li>
      </ol>
